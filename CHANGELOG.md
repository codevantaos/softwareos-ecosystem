- Multi-engine inference routing across 7 backends (vLLM, TGI, Ollama, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, DeepSpeed, LMDeploy)
- OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`)
- Async job queue with priority scheduling (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW) and WebSocket status updates
- Model registry with lifecycle management and capability filtering
- Request queue with priority-based async dequeuing
- Pydantic v2 schemas for auth, inference, and model definitions
- API key + JWT authentication middleware with RBAC (admin/developer/viewer)

#### AI Service (`backend/ai/`)

- FastAPI application with lifespan-managed services
- 7 inference engine adapters with unified `BaseInferenceAdapter` interface
- `EngineManager` with automatic failover and health-based routing
- `CircuitBreaker` state machine (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN) per engine
