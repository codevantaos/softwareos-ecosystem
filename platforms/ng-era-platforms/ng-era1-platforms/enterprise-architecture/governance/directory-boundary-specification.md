# GL Directory Boundary Specification v1.0.0

## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Version** | 1.0.0 |
| **Status** | CONSTITUTIONAL |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-01-31 |
| **Governance Level** | GL90-99 |
| **Enforcement** | MANDATORY |

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines comprehensive boundary specifications for all directories within the MachineNativeOps project. It establishes clear responsibility boundaries, interaction protocols, and architectural principles governing the 8-layer GL enterprise architecture.

### 1.1 Purpose

- Define clear responsibility boundaries for each directory layer
- Establish allowed interactions between directories
- Prevent circular dependencies and architectural violations
- Enable autonomous development within bounded contexts
- Support the zero-dependency platform philosophy

### 1.2 Scope

This specification applies to all 8 GL layers and their subdirectories:
- GL00-09: gl-enterprise-architecture
- GL10-29: gl-platform-services
- GL20-29: gl-data-processing
- GL30-49: gl-execution-runtime
- GL50-59: gl-observability
- GL60-80: gl-governance-compliance
- GL81-83: gl-extension-services
- GL90-99: gl-meta-specifications

## 2. Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

1. **Single Directional Dependency Flow**
   - Dependencies flow from higher layers to lower layers only
   - No circular dependencies permitted
   - Lower layers cannot depend on upper layers

2. **Explicit Interface Definition**
   - All cross-directory interactions must have explicit softwareos-contracts
   - API softwareos-contracts define allowed method signatures
   - Event softwareos-contracts define allowed message formats

3. **Autonomous Operation Capability**
   - Each directory must be capable of independent operation
   - No directory requires another to function
   - Optional dependencies must be handled gracefully

4. **Zero External Dependency Philosophy**
   - All dependencies must be internal
   - No external network calls permitted
   - All libraries must be locally available

### 2.2 Boundary Enforcement Levels

| Level | Description | Enforcement |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Constitutional | Architectural principles that cannot be violated | MANDATORY |
| Regulatory | Layer-specific interaction rules | MANDATORY |
| Operational | Directory-specific implementation guidelines | RECOMMENDED |
| Advisory | Best practices and conventions | OPTIONAL |

- - = Self-reference

### 4.2 Interaction Patterns

#### 4.2.1 Synchronous API Calls
- Used for request/response interactions
- Must have explicit interface softwareos-contracts
- Timeout requirements defined
- Error handling mandatory

#### 4.2.2 Asynchronous Event Messaging
- Used for decoupled communication
- Event softwareos-contracts define message structure
- Event sourcing for reliability
- Dead letter queue for failed events

#### 4.2.3 Shared Data Access
- Used for read-only data sharing
- Data softwareos-contracts define access patterns
- No direct modification across boundaries
- Copy-on-write for isolation

#### 4.2.4 Service Discovery
- Used for dynamic service location
- Registration softwareos-contracts defined
- Health checking mandatory
- Load balancing support

### 4.3 Interface Contract Requirements

Every cross-boundary interface must define:

1. **Functional Contract**
   - Method signatures
   - Parameter types
   - Return types
   - Error conditions

2. **Non-Functional Contract**
   - Performance requirements
   - Availability SLA
   - Security requirements
   - Rate limiting

3. **Data Contract**
   - Data schemas
   - Validation rules
   - Version compatibility
   - Migration strategy

4. **Operational Contract**
   - Deployment requirements
   - Monitoring hooks
   - Logging requirements
   - Support procedures

## 5. Boundary Violation Detection

### 5.1 Common Violations

#### 5.1.1 Circular Dependencies
**Example**: GL30-49 depends on GL10-29, GL10-49 depends on GL30-49
**Detection**: Static analysis of dependency graph
**Impact**: Unresolvable initialization, unpredictable behavior
**Prevention**: Dependency matrix enforcement, layer ordering

#### 5.1.2 Leaky Abstractions
**Example**: GL20-49 exposing GL20-49 internals to GL10-29
**Detection**: Interface compliance checking
**Impact**: Tight coupling, reduced autonomy
**Prevention**: Strict interface softwareos-contracts, encapsulation

#### 5.1.3 Responsibility Creep
**Example**: GL10-29 implementing GL60-49 functionality
**Detection**: Responsibility boundary analysis
**Impact**: Confusion, duplication, maintenance burden
**Prevention**: Clear responsibility definitions, regular reviews

### 5.2 Detection Mechanisms

#### 5.2.1 Static Analysis
- Import statement scanning
- Dependency graph analysis
- Interface compliance checking
- Code pattern detection

#### 5.2.2 Runtime Validation
- Dependency injection validation
- Interface contract enforcement
- Permission checking
- Access control verification

#### 5.2.3 Automated Testing
- Boundary violation tests
- Dependency isolation tests
- Interface contract tests
- Autonomy verification tests

### 5.3 Enforcement Actions

| Violation Type | Severity | Action |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Circular Dependency | CRITICAL | Reject commit |
| Leaky Abstraction | HIGH | Require fix before merge |
| Responsibility Creep | MEDIUM | Warning + review |
| Missing Contract | MEDIUM | Require contract definition |
| Unvalidated Access | LOW | Warning + documentation |
