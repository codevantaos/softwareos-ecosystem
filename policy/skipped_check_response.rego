package eco_base.skipped_check_response

# ── Skipped Architecture Content Response Policy ─────────────────────────────
# URI: softwareos-base://policy/skipped-check-response
# Purpose: Define what happens when a check is skipped (conclusion=skipped)
#          rather than passed or failed. Skipped checks are NOT failures and
#          MUST NOT block merge.
#
# Skipped check categories and their responses:
#
# CATEGORY A — Conditional skips (expected, by design):
#   auto-fix:           Only runs on main branch failures. Skipped on PRs = correct.
#   Supabase Preview:   Only runs when branch is linked to Supabase. Skipped = correct.
#   request-codacy-review: Only runs when codacy-review label is present. Skipped = correct.
#
# CATEGORY B — External service skips (not required for merge):
#   Supabase Preview:   External service, not a required check.
#   Cloudflare Pages:   External deploy preview, informational only.
#
# CATEGORY C — Unexpected skips (required check was skipped):
#   If a REQUIRED check (validate/lint/test/build/opa-policy/supply-chain) is
#   skipped, this is treated as PENDING (not failure) and CI is re-triggered.
