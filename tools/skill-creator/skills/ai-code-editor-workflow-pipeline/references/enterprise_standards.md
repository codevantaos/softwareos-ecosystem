# Enterprise Standards & Compliance

## SLSA Level 3 Requirements

### Build Process Isolation

- Build runs in isolated, ephemeral environment (no external influence)
- Build environment is hardened (minimal tools, no user access)
- Build logs are captured and retained

### Provenance Generation

- Build produces signed provenance attestation (in-toto format)
- Provenance includes build inputs, outputs, environment
- Provenance is cryptographically signed and independently verifiable

### Reproducible Builds

- Same inputs produce same outputs (deterministic)
- Build dependencies are pinned (no floating versions)
- Build can be reproduced by third parties

### Signed Provenance
- Provenance signed with cosign
- Signature verifiable with public key
- Key rotation tracked and audited

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

### CycloneDX Format
```json
{
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.5",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "library",
      "name": "fastapi",
      "version": "0.115.0",
      "purl": "pkg:pypi/fastapi@0.115.0",
      "hashes": [{ "alg": "SHA-256", "content": "..." }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Signing & Verification
```bash
# Sign SBOM
cosign sign-blob --key cosign.key sbom.json > sbom.json.sig

# Verify signature
cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --signature sbom.json.sig sbom.json
```

## Audit Trails

### Immutable Storage
- **S3 Object Lock**: WORM (Write Once Read Many) with compliance mode
- **Append-only DB**: PostgreSQL with row-level security, no UPDATE/DELETE
- **Retention**: Minimum 7 years for compliance records

### Audit Log Entry Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
  "trace_id": "UUID v1",
  "actor": "ai-code-editor-workflow-pipeline",
  "action": "automated-remediation",
  "resource": "path/to/file",
  "result": "success | failure",
  "policy_version": "v1.0.0",
  "compliance_tags": ["slsa-l3", "soc2"],
  "content_hash": "sha256:...",
  "governance_stamp": {
    "uri": "softwareos-base://...",
    "urn": "urn:softwareos-base:..."
  }
}
```

## SLO Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Availability | >= 99.99% | Uptime over 30-day window |
| P95 Latency | <= 200ms | Request processing time |
| Error Rate | <= 0.1% | Failed requests / total requests |
| Fix Success Rate | >= 90% | Successful remediations / total attempts |
| False Positive Rate | <= 10% | False alerts / total alerts |

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOC2 Type II
- Access controls and authentication (Auth Service integration)
- Change management and audit trails
- Incident response and remediation tracking
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

### ISO 27001
- Information security management system (ISMS)
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Security controls implementation
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

## softwareos-base Alignment

All enterprise standards integrate with the softwareos-base governance model:
- **UUID v1** for all trace IDs and audit records
- **URI/URN** dual identification for all audit entries
- **ECO_*** environment variable prefix for all configuration
- **.qyaml** governance blocks for all K8s manifests
- **CI Validator Engine** for automated compliance verification
